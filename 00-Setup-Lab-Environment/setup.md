## LAB Prerequisites

1. Install Docker for Desktop Windows or Mac.

**Linux** - Install your flavor of Docker for Linux https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

**Mac** - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

**Windows** - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

**For Windows users, ensure you switch to Linux containers** - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers

2. Once Docker is installed, let's verify the docker installation. Open a terminal window (Windows users open Powershell with Admin rights). Next, run the following command

```docker
    docker run hello-world
```

3. If the command completes successfully you should see a hello message from Docker. If the command failed, be sure to revisit the step 1 instructions on installing Docker for Desktop for your Operating System.

4. Install Git, so we can check out the Labs - https://git-scm.com/downloads or GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/

What if Docker Desktop doesn't work?
In some cases, Docker Desktop will not work due to the version of your operating system of IT policies in your company. Don't worry, we have a solution for this as well. 

You can use the online Docker console provided by Docker. This works entirely in your browser - https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

Check out the Labs
Now, let's check out the Labs which contain all the resources for each lab. From your terminal window, Git client, GitHub Desktop, or Visual Studio code clone the Traefik Training Repo.

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/56kcloud/traefik-training.git
```

You can find the Traefik Training GitHub Repo here - https://github.com/56kcloud/traefik-training
