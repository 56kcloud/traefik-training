## 1. Starting Traefik for the first time
1. Open you Terminal window and change to the `01-Traefik-Overview` folder
2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in your favorite editor and review how Docker starts Traefik
3. From the `01-Traefik-Overview` directory execute this command -> `docker-compose up -d`
4. Review the logs output `docker-compose logs`

##  2. Connect a new service to Traefik
1. Uncomment the below whoami section inside the `docker-compose.yml`. Review the `whoami.yml` file for the complete solution.

```yaml
whoami:
     # A container that exposes an API to show its IP address
     image: containous/whoami
     # We set a label to tell Traefik to assign a hostname to the new service
     labels:
       - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=Host(`whoami.docker.localhost`)"
```

2. Run `docker-compose up -d whoami`
3. Open a browser tab and paste `whoami.docker.localhost`  or from a terminal window `curl -H Host:whoami.docker.localhost http://127.0.0.1` and you should see the below results but with your IP addresses.

```yml
Hostname: 931789a57923
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 172.20.0.3
RemoteAddr: 172.20.0.2:46648

```

##  3. Scale the Whoami service to 3x
1. Open you Terminal window and change to the `01-Traefik-Overview` folder
2. Let's scale the `whoami` service to 3x instances by typing `docker-compose scale whoami=3`
3. Open a browser tab and paste `whoami.docker.localhost`  or from a terminal window `curl -H Host:whoami.docker.localhost http://127.0.0.1` and you should see the 3rd IP address update based on which service is responding.

##  4. Get to know the Traefik Dashboard
1. Open a browser tab and type or click: http://0.0.0.0:8080 to open the Traefik Dashboard
