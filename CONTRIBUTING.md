Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to [56K.Cloud Training](https://training.56k.cloud) tutorials. We want to give back to the Open Source community what we have learned and taught over the years. We offer training to companies, organizations, and individuals. 56K believes that everything should be Open Source and it is an integral part of our company including the training we offer.

Just a few quick things to be aware of before you get started.

We welcome issues and pull requests for either adding a new tutorial, or fixing a problem with an existing tutorial. This is a repository for tutorials that uses the native componentes of Docker & Kubernetes based projects as much as possible. So if there’s a Docker or Kubernetes tool for what you’re describing, please use that.

Anything you contribute will be under an Apache license. Anything posted here may be forked by anyone on GitHub.

We will be following the lightweight version of the Docker contribution policies and procedures as explained in
